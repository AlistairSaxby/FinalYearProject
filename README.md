This model has been saved as a .pickle file 'LinearRegressionmodel', 'MVP1' which when ran enables a small system for the user to use the model for prediction of either a single input or a csv file of inputs. Th intention would be to use this to model a bigger web application which would perform the same functinality.

The data used in the model is in .csv format 'PYTHONDATA'. Before using these script you need ensure you have installed several packages, using the standard installer pip is advisable.
